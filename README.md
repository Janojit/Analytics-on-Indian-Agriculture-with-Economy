Project: Analytics on Indian Agriculture with Economy

Data Taken From:
- Dataset - 1: http://data.icrisat.org/dld/src/crops.html
- Dataset - 2: http://surl.li/hqvso
- Dataset - 3: http://surl.li/hqvsq

Objective:
- Analyse Agricultural Data and fetch maximum insights from it
- Make a comparision between Agriculture and Economy
- Create Predictive Models
- Deploy ML model into API
- Problem Definition
- Make an analytical project on Agricultural Industry in India by analyzing State-wise agriculture and how it is effecting their Economy and try to fetch unique insights from it. Based on the parameters(Crop Production,Rainfall,GDP etc) try to make a predictive model out of it.

Approach/Methods:
- First we need to import the datasets
- Clean and Preprocess datasets to make it mergeable
- Merge the datasets based on common attributes and entries
- Make an analysis through EDA by using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Libraries
- Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning Modelling
- Create Regresssion Model and Store it into Pickle file
- Deploy Regression Models using Streamlit

Results:
- Created an API with Two sections Predict and Explore
- In the Predict section We can Predict Desirable Attributes
- The Explore section consists with Exploratiory Data Analysis
- Learnings & Reflection:
- Learned about PDF Scraping
- Learned different aspects of Merging different datasets
- Get more knowledge about Plotly Library
- Get know about Model deployement technics
- Learned about different Regression models
- Learned about Streamlit
